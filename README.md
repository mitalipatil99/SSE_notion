## BLOGPOST STUFF 
As students we use various note taking softwares often, but which software is an environmantally conscious choice? In this blogpost we answer this question by comparing the energy consumption between the desktop versions of evernote and notion. We present arguments on why one might be better sustainable software choice than the other.

Most students at TU Delft use either evernote or Notion and as a part of a sustainable university, we share our insights into how we can contribute to lesser carbon emissions by just changing the note taking application we use on a day to day basis.
